title: ULTRRA Challenge 2025
description: The ULTRRA challenge evaluates current and novel state of the art view
  synthesis methods for posed and unposed cameras. Challenge datasets emphasize real-world
  considerations, such as image sparsity, variety of camera models, and unconstrained acquisition in real-world environments.

  description: During the development phase, both camera calibration and view synthesis
    tasks will be evaluated using images from the same scene. Reference values for
    both tasks are provided in the development data package, allowing participants
    to  independently experiment and self-evaluate and also confirm that submissions
    to the leaderboard are formatted correctly.
