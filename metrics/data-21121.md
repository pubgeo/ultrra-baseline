<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Images collected for the IARPA WRIVA program have been publicly released and made available for use in this public challenge and more broadly to encourage research in view synthesis methods for real-world environments and heterogeneous cameras. Datasets include images collected from mobile phones and other ground-level cameras, security cameras, and airborne cameras. Each camera is calibrated using structure from motion constrained by RTK-corrected GPS coordinates, with accuracies measured in centimeters, for either camera locations or ground control points, depending on the camera. Cameras are geolocated to enable reliable evaluation. Images used for final evaluations are sequestered.</p>
<p>Development datasets are available for download at <a href="https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/ultrra-challenge-2025">IEEE DataPort</a>, and the challenge datasets will be posted there 10 January 2025.</p>
